Future package planning: 

Vignette proposed
- significance of abundence across treatments
- histogram: Abundence of type X (ie 'lipid') across samples

Function wish list
- NMNDNS (NDMS) and PCA (package, vegan/FactorMineR already does alot of this)
- plot C number vs HtoC/DBE/OtoC
- plot O number vs DBE
- Cluster analysis of presence/absence for mass:charge
- plot(x=Cnumber, y=occurance, color=Onumber or DBE)
- aggregate groups of sample by common and 'mostly' common
  |- compare groups across treatments w/ ven diagrams (common vs unique)
