Future package planning: 

Vignette proposed
- significance of abundence across treatments
- histogram: Abundence of type X (ie 'lipid') across samples

Function wish list
- NMNDNS (NMDS) and PCA (package, vegan/FactorMineR already does alot of this)
- Van Krevelen (H:C vs O:C)
  + color plot based on N/S inclusion
  + color on mass to charge (M:Z)
- histogram of O2, O3, O4 (...) counts/relative abundence
- Kendric plot
  + mass vs Kendric mass defect (mass/ [mass of CH2 or COO])
- average of ratio (ie O:C) option to weight by intensity
- plot C number vs HC/DEB/OC
- Cluster analysis of presence/absence for mass:charge
